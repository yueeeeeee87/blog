## Project Description
The main goal of this project is to identify and predict the loan status of lenders.   
To figure out whether the dataset has time series characteristic, two cross-validation methods (**K-fold, TimeSplit**) are also used.  
In this project, RandomForest is the main model to predict and analyze the loan status.  
*(The Dataset for model training includes 916567 rows and 10 columns from 2007 to 2017.)*
<br/><br/>
### Response Variable

* Loan_Stat -> Including 3 status, Fully Paid, Charged Off, and Default
<br/><br/>

### Explanatory Variables
* Annual_Inc -> Annual income  
* Emp_Length -> Employment length  
* Dti ->  The debt-to-income ratio of the borrower  
* Delinq_2yrs -> The number of times the borrower had been 30+ days past due on a payment in the past 2 years  
* Term -> Borrowing term  
* Grade -> History credit grading  
* Inq_Last_6mths -> The borrowerâ€™s number of inquiries by creditors in the last 6 months  
* Purpose -> Purpose for borrowing  

<br/><br/>

## Feature Engineering
### loan_stat  
Fully_Paid -> 0  
Defult, Charged-Off -> 1  
### Grade  
A, B, C, D, E, F, D -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
### Purpose  
Debt_Consolidation -> 1  
Other -> 0 
<br/><br/>




```python
#getting dummies for loan_status
data_df['loan_status'] = data_df['loan_status'].str.replace('Charged Off', '1')
data_df['loan_status'] = data_df['loan_status'].str.replace('Default', '1')
data_df['loan_status'] = data_df['loan_status'].str.replace('Fully Paid', '0')

#getting dummies for purpose
data_df.loc[data_df['purpose'] != 'debt_consolidation', 'purpose'] = 0
data_df.loc[data_df['purpose'] == 'debt_consolidation', 'purpose'] = 1
```
